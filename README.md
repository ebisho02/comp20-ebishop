1. This repository contains many of the assignments I worked on while taking
   Ming's Web Programming course.
2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 2, because the end product reflected
   the amount of time and effort I put into it. Actually writing the code
   for it was not my favorite, though.
3. I've grown a lot since day one of the course, I now have a much better 
   understanding of the way the web works and the architecture of web 
   applications. 
4. The two points I noted in question three (gaining a better understanding
   of the way the web works and a better understanding of the architecture
   of web applications) are the two items that I think are most important 
   to me. Now when I use a website or app, I think to myself -- oh! this is
   using local storage! or, wow! this site is taking a longer time to load 
   because the server is in Japan! Things like this, that I think about as
   I'm going about my life, I think are the most valuable because they are
   the most likely to stick with me as I continue to learn.
5. I'm more interested in working on the front-end of websites, as well as
   exploring the ways that individual privacy can better be protected
   from surveillance.
