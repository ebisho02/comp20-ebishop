	<h1>COMP20: Assignment 4</h1>
		<p>by: Elizabeth Bishop</p>
		<p>Last modified: April 25, 2016</p>
	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>This document assesses the security of Elias's "Historic Landmarks" 
		application. "Historic Landmarks" is a web application that "maintains
		location check-ins (login, latitute, and longitude)... and serves data
		on the nearest U.S. historic landmarks within a mile of where you are."
		"Historic Landmarks" can be connected with a web page that retrieves and
		displays the locations of other people who checked-in to the app and the 
		nearest historic landmarks on a map (using the Google Maps API). The 
		application, however, is not secure and can be manipulated by users. 
		This report will outline such vulnerabilities.  </p>
		<p> Elias's app can be found 
			<a href= "https://ancient-beach-16992.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>Methodology:</h2>
		<p>For my first, third, and fourth bullet points, I used "curl" from my 
		terminal, to send different sorts of unexpected data to Elias's server. 
		I sent all data using the expected format of providing a login variable,
		 a latitude variable, and a longitude variable, but I gave one of these
		 variables an unexpected value. For the second bullet point, I inserted
		 an unexpected field into the url of one of the pages of the web 
		 application. Because the app does not check to make sure that the url
		 or posted data meets certain expectations, sending unexpected data
		 allowed me to pinpoint several vulnerabilities. </p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings:</h2>
		<p> Because this app was written without taking into security into 
		account, it leaves its contents and information vulnerable. This means
		that people can potentially alter the body of the app's web pages (and
		cause it to contain malicious content), query the app's information in
		unexpected ways (potentially allowing private information to be 
		exposed), and generally attack the application and its users. These 
		scenarios, and recommendations as to how they should be resolved, are
		listed below. 
		</p>
	<h2>Description of Three Issues that Were Found:</h2>
		<li>Injection of HTML</li>
			<ul><li> Location: /sendLocation POST requests</li>
				<li> Severity of Issue: High. If someone were to inject 
					 inappropriate content into your database, it would be 
					 displayed on both your index page and your /checkins.json
					 page. It would severely tarnish the reputation of your
					 application. </li>
				<li> Description of Issue: In a post request, anyone can send
					 to the app data in the form of "login=X&lat=X&lng=X" The 
					 user may send any data through this form: words, numbers,
					 even images. The below image shows the data that I entered
					 when I entered my login as an image.</li> </ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="curlbaby.png" alt="injecting a photo
				using curl" title="using curl to send an image to the database
				" /> </div>
				<ul><li> Proof of vulnerability: The below image shows one of
						 the results of curl statement depicted above. Because 
						 the image that I sent was accepted by the application,
						 and stored in the application's database, it can be 
						 viewed by anyone visiting the application's index page
						 (or its /checkins.json page). While the below image is 
						 cute, it is not hard to imagine the other sorts of 
						 malicious things people might mangle your html with. 
						 </li></ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="surprise.png" alt="login = 
				surprised child" title=
				"an undesirable image is appearing in the body of your web page"
				 /> </div>
			<ul><li> Resolution: To resolve this issue, the server needs to 
				assert that the data is receiving from a /sendLocation POST
				request meets certain standards. For instance, there could be 
				a statement that translates "<" and ">" characters into 
				"(ampersand character)lt" and "(ampersand character)gt." 
			</li></ul>
			</div>
		<li>Injection of Mongo Operator</li>
			<ul><li> Location: /checkins.json</li>
				<li> Severity of Issue: Low. At the moment, all of the data
					accessible from the /checkins.json page can also be viewed
					in the index page of the application. However, if the app
					were ever to be changed to collect more user information,
					not displayed on the index page, this vulnerability would
					make the information accessible to the public.</li>
				<li> Description of Issue: If you look at the below image,
					 you can see the way that I altered the URL to contain
					 the mongo operator [$ne] (which stands for not equals) 
					 "login[$ne]=mchowgrading". The page /checkins.json
					 is supposed to return all records for a given login. 
					 However, by using injecting [$ne], the page can be
					 manipulated to provide other kinds of data. For 
					 instance, it can return all data that doesn't equal
					 a certain login.
					</li>
				<li> Proof of vulnerability: As can be seen below, sending
					 "login[$ne]=mchowgrading" as a query string to 
					 /checkins.json returns all of the information for
					 logins that are not "mchowgrading."
				 </li>
			</ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="mongo.png" alt="querying mongo" 
				title="Illegal mongo query" /></div>
			</div>
			<ul><li> Resolution: By looking at the source code, I can see that
				the server is storing the query string as a Javascript object.
				I recommend that this data is instead stored as a string, so 
				that it cannot be used as a mongo query.</li></ul>
		<li>Cross-site Scripting</li>
			<ul><li> Location: /sendLocation POST requests</li>
				<li> Severity of Issue: High. Cross site scripting is very 
					dangerous because it can be used to steal user information,
					redirect web pages to malicious web pages, and do other
					bad things that are sure to drive users away from your 
					application.
				 </li> 
				<li> Description of Issue: Similarly to the HTML injection 
					 bullet point, cross-site scripting can take advantage of 
					 the fact that anyone can send
					 to the app data in the form of "login=X&lat=X&lng=X" The 
					 user may send any data through this form: words, numbers,
					 even images. In a cross-site scripting attack, the 
					 attacker sends a script to the app. This script is then
					 stored in the database, and eventually displayed on the
					 home page of the application. In that HTML page, the
					 script, which the application expects to be a login or
					 a latitude or longitude value, is then run from that page.
					</li>
				</ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="curl_xss.png" alt="xss attack" 
				title=
				"popup generated by cross site scripting attack"/>
			</div>
			<ul><li> Proof of vulnerability: The below image shows what happens
					 when you send a simple script to the page. This script
					 causes an annoying pop up, but, as stated earlier, in a 
					 real attack could instead contain something much more
					 troublesome.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="xss.png" alt="xss attack" 
				title=
				"popup generated by cross site scripting attack"/>
			</div>
			<ul><li> Resolution: I recommend the same resolution as I would for
				     the issue of HTML injection. You could write an assertion
				     that checks the data before it is entered in the database,
				     and translates "<" and ">" tags to 
				     "(ampersand character)lt" and "(ampersand character)gt."
				 </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Sending data incompatable with Google Maps API</li>
			<ul><li> Location: /sendLocation POST requests</li>
				<li> Severity of Issue: Medium. This issue causes the server 
					send an incomprehensible error message, and behaves 
					in a way that does not meet specifications. 
					An unreliable application that creates unexpected
					results is not the kind of application that you should
					provide to your users if you want them to continue to
					use your application.</li> 
				<li> Description of Issue: When latitude or longitude
					values exceed what is possible (the maximum possible 
					latitude is 90 and the maximum possible longitude is
					180), the server crashes. The client that sent the data
					received an odd response (see image below), and not the
					coordinates of other check-ins and landmarks. However,
				 	the bad data is still entered into the database and still
				 	appears when a client accesses the index page and can be 
				 	through a query on the /checkins.json page.</li>
				<li> Proof of vulnerability: The server crashing can be seen
					in the image depicted below. I sent the server a latitude
					of 200 and a longitude of 200, and received back a
					strange error message that was not specified by Elias.
					Additionally, if you look at the second image, you can see
					that the data, is stored in the database, despite the fact
					that the expected json array response of check-ins and 
					landmarks is not returned. </li>
			</ul>
			<div class = issue> <img src="confusing.png" alt="error message" 
				title=
				"error generated by sending illegal latitude and longitude"/>
			</div>
			<div class = issue> <img src="confusing2.png" alt="proof that it
				entered database" 
				title=
				"bad data is stored in database"/>
			</div>
			<ul><li> Resolution: When accepting data from the POST request,
				check to make sure that the longitude and latitude values are 
				within the possible range. If they are not, send the error 
				message that is sent when the user provides other sorts of bad
				data.</li></ul>
	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
		<p> Paying attention to security is very important because otherwise
		people with bad intensions can distort the information that your users
		receive, and may even put your users at risk of clicking through to 
		malicious websites. Poor attention to security may also allow people
		to access your or your user's personal information. Please be careful!
		Fixing these issues will not cost much and will make your application
		more reliable and pleasing to your users. I think that you could solve
		them yourself, and thus cost yourself nothing, if you just spend some
		time searching the internet for advice as to how to code the solutions
		recommended above.
