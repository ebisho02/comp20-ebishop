	<h1>COMP20: Assignment 4</h1>
		<p>by: Elizabeth Bishop</p>
		<p>Last modified: April 23, 2016</p>

	<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>This document assesses the security of Elias's "Historic Landmarks" 
		application. "Historic Landmarks" is a web application that "maintains
		location check-ins (login, latitute, and longitude)... and serves data
		on the nearest U.S. historic landmarks within a mile of where you are."
		"Historic Landmarks" can be connected with a web page that retrieves and
		displays the locations of other people who checked-in to the app and the 
		nearest historic landmarks on a map. The application, however, is not
		secure and can be manipulated by users. This report will outline such
		vulnerabilities.  </p>
		<p> Elias's app can be found 
			<a href= "https://ancient-beach-16992.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>Methodology:</h2>
		<p>Using "curl" from my terminal, I sent different sorts of unexpected
		data to Elias's server. I sent all data using the expected format of
		providing a login variable, a latitude variable, and a longitude 
		variable, but I gave each of these variables unexpected values.
		Just through this method, I was able to find several vulnerabilities, 
		which are outlined below. </p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings:</h2>
		<p> Will write this later.
		</p>
	<h2>Issues Found:</h2>
		<li>Cross site scripting</li>
			<div class = issue> wow 
			</div>
			<div class = issue> <img src="surprise.png" alt="login = 
				surprised child" title="Surprised child" />
			</div>
		<li>Mongo queries</li>
			<div class = issue> this is great
			</div>
			<div class = issue> <img src="mongo.png" alt="querying mongo" 
				title="Illegal mongo query" />
			</div>
		<li>Sending Data incompatable with Google Maps API</li>
			<div class = issue> wow
			</div>
			<div class = issue> <img src="confusing.png" alt="Internal server
				error" title="Sending illegal lat and long" />
			</div>
	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
		<p> Paying attention to security is very important because otherwise
		people with bad intensions can distort the information that your users
		receive, and may even put your users at risk of clicking through to 
		malicious websites. Poor attention to security may also allow people
		to access your or your user's personal information. Please be careful!
